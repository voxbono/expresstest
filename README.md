## Synopsis
ExpressTest is the ultimate express seed project. Containing everything you need get up and running with pure express.js
## Code Example

`npm start`
## Motivation

* **Declarative:** ExpressTest makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and ExpressTest will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in ExpressTest without rewriting existing code. ExpressTest can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using ExpressTestMobile (coming soon).
